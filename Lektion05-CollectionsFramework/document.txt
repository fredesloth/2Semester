The following program shows a practical application of sets. It reads in all words
from a dictionary file that contains correctly spelled words and places them in a set.
It then reads all words from a document here, the book Alice in Wonderland into
a second set. Finally, it prints all words from that set that are not in the dictionary
set. These are the potential misspellings. (As you can see from the output, we used an
American dictionary, and words with British spelling, such as clamour, are flagged as
potential errors.
